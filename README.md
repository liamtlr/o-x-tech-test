# Rough User stories

As a user,
So that I can play noughts and crosses
I want to be able to select a place to put my X or O

As a user,
So that I can plan my next move
I want to see which fields are already taken

As a user,
So that I can play a proper game
I want to be unable to take a field that is already taken

As a user,
So that I know who has won
I want to be able to see the outcome of the game once it is complete
